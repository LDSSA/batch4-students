    "\n",
    "In the context of data wrangling, we've already talked about three data sources: files, databases and public APIs.\n",
    "Now it's time to delve into the Web!\n",
    "\n",
    "As we all know, there is a huge amount of data in the Web. Whenever we search something on Google, it shows us thousands of web pages full of answers.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, there is a problem here: in most of the cases, the web pages show us the data in a beautiful but unstructured way. This makes sense, since the purpose of a web page is to be read by a human and not to have its content analysed by some computer program.\n",
    "\n",
    "So we are left with the boring task of copying and pasting the data we want into csv files or excel tables, possibly thousands of times, before feeding it to some data model...\n",
    "\n",
    "But worry no more!\n",

    "\n",
    "[Web scraping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_scraping) is the name given to the process of extracting data from web pages in an automated way.\n",
    "There are many [techniques](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_scraping#Techniques) that can be used to do web scraping and the one we're going to explore here is HTML parsing.\n",
    "\n",
    "A web page is an HTML document, so HTML parsing means to split the contents of a web page into several small pieces and select the parts we find interesting. This technique is usefull when we want to extract data from many web pages that share a common template."

    "## 3. Understanding the HTML code of a web page\n",
    "\n",
    "Before jumping to the part where we actually do web scraping, let's first understand the structure and code of a web page.\n",
    "\n",
    "Usually, a web page has 3 different types of code:\n",
    "* **HTML**: used to display the content of the web page\n",
    "* **CSS**: used to apply styles to the web page, it's what makes the page pretty\n",
    "* **JavaScript**: this is what makes the page dynamic, like triggering an action when a button is clicked.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll focus now on the HTML part, since it's the one that concerns what we want, which is data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In file **../web_pages/nationalmuseum.html** you can see an example of an HTML document that represents a web page. Let's see the code."

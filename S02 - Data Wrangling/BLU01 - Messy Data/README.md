# Big Learning Unit 1 - Messy data

## What is in this BLU?

#### Main topics

- Alternative tabular sources
- Non-tabular data sources
- Common problems and solutions

#### Summary

Welcome to the Data Wrangling specialization.
Here you'll learn how to get data from multiple data sources and how to transform raw data into clean enough data so that you can begin your data science workflow.

This is the first BLU in the Data Wrangling specialization. It's about common problems when handling alternative structured data files such as **csv files** (with specific delimiters or corrupt data) and **non-csv formats** (like excel with multiple sheets or json files).
It also covers handling larger datasets, including using some Jupyter notebooks magics and loading big files using chunks. 

Good luck!


## How to go through this BLU

1. Follow the [Learning Unit Workflow](https://github.com/LDSSA/batch4-students#learning-unit-workflow) to setup your environment.
1. Go through the Learning Notebooks (there's three of them).
1. Do the Exercise notebook, and submit it on [the portal](https://portal.lisbondatascience.org), as usual.


## "I need help understanding something"

You can and should ask for help, be it about Learning Notebooks, Exercises, or anything else. Please checkout the [How to Ask for Help](https://github.com/LDSSA/wiki/wiki/How-to-ask-for-and-give-help), and remember not to share code when asking for help about the exercises!

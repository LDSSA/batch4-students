# Big Learning Unit 8 -  Feature Modeling and Dimensionality Reduction NLP

## What is in this BLU?

This is the second big learning unit of the text classification specialization. It will introduce you to common tools and methods for selecting the most informative text features from a corpus and for avoiding the "curse of dimensionality."

#### Main topics

- Feature relevance and chi squared 
- Dimensionality reduction

## How to go through this BLU

1. Follow the [Learning Unit Workflow](https://github.com/LDSSA/batch4-students#learning-unit-workflow) to setup your environment.
1. Additionally, creating the environment should install an extra file for part 3 and the exercises, but to install it manually run:

   ```
   python -m spacy download en_core_web_md
   ```
2. Go through the Learning Notebooks (there's three of them).
3. Do the Exercise notebook, and submit it on [the portal](https://portal.lisbondatascience.org), as usual.

## "I need help understanding something"

You can and should ask for help, be it about Learning Notebooks, Exercises, or anything else. Please checkout the [How to Ask for Help](https://github.com/LDSSA/wiki/wiki/How-to-ask-for-and-give-help), and remember not to share code when asking for help about the exercises!

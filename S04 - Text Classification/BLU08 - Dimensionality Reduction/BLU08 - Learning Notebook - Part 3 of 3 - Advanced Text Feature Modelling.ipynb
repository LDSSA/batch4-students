    "\n",
    "So far we've seen simple feature selection methods, a statistical feature selection approach, dimensionality reduction techniques such as PCA and SVD, but in the last few years, with the rise in popularity of Neural Networks, a new technique has become the state of the art for representing words in NLP tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "This technique is commonly referred to as word vectors or word embeddings, and its inner workings are really simple. It consists of defining a vocabulary and a vector for each word in it with a maximum number of dimensions. Then all the vectors' weights are found through the use of neural networks. In essence, word embeddings try to capture information a word's meaning and usage. This not only allows us to reduce significantly the number of features inputed to our models, but it also allows meaningful and easy representations across the data, that are transferrable among tasks. \n",

    "First of all, by now you could be thinking: \"But wait Doc, didn't I get a bunch of vectors before also?\". Why yes, yes you did Marty.

These are the words of John Rupert Firth (at least according to wikipedia), and they are the basis of the following method - Word2vec. \n",

[Spacy](https://spacy.io) is a toolkit similar to NLTK, but it contains embedded deep learning models for NLP and it typically has better performance for industrial applications.

At this point, if you did not go through the README carefully, you should run this command to download the required models:\n",

    "In this last part, we've shown you that word vectors are pretty useful and intuitive, keeping meaningful information about words in a compact feature space. If you wish to dig further into these word representations we would suggest this [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1301.3781.pdf). As before, take into consideration that although they can be used as an out of the box solution for several NLP tasks, all the factors mentioned before will affect your model performance. So once again, you should still be careful with:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Initial text preprocessing\n",
    "- Choice of classifier\n",
    "- Parameter selection\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, for most of NLP tasks, neural networks have been showing extremely good performance, and if you really want to get into this field, you should learn more about that. However, these basic techniques are essential to understand some of the reasoning when handling text and can still prove quite useful to us.\n",
    "\n",
    "And that's it for this BLU. You have come out the other side with a much wider view of the different methods and reasoning you can take when handling features in NLP (and outside NLP) in a high dimensional space. There is so much more, but these basic tools should suffice for you to start working with text data and to understand more complex approaches built on top of these methods. See you in the next BLU!\n",

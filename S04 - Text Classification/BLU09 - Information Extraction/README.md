# BLU09 - Information Extraction

## What is in this BLU?

This big learning unit continues the text classification specialization. Now that you know how to process text and extract meaningfull features, we will show you how to prepare these features so you can actually use them for your task, for example text classification.

We will focus on how to go from a huge set of features to a more tractable set, more useful for the modelling of our problem.

If you are able to solve this BLU, you are equipped with one more set of tools to succeed in the hackathon :)

## How to go through this BLU

1. Follow the [Learning Unit Workflow](https://github.com/LDSSA/batch4-students#learning-unit-workflow) to setup your environment.
1. Go through the Learning Notebooks (there's two of them).
1. Do the Exercise notebook, and submit it on [the portal](https://portal.lisbondatascience.org), as usual.

# Big Learning Unit 14 - Deployment in Real World

## What is in this BLU?

#### Main topics

- Formalizing client requirements
- Dealing with unexpected inputs
- Uptime and surviving failures

#### Summary

In this BLU, you'll learn how to deploy your model in the wild. For that purpose, you need to deal with the uncertainty that comes with it and prepare for a jungle of weird inputs and requests that can mess up your app and/or your model. You'll be learning how to design your model and app to meet client requirements, how to handle problematic scenarios, and how to keep your system alive. 

## How to go through this BLU

1. Follow the [Learning Unit Workflow](https://github.com/LDSSA/batch4-students#learning-unit-workflow) to setup your environment.
1. Go through the Learning Notebooks (there's two of them).
1. Do the Exercise notebook, and submit it on [the portal](https://portal.lisbondatascience.org), as usual.

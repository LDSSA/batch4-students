    "## Basic Rules\n",
    "\n",
    "### Make stuff read-only\n",
    "\n",
    "Make as many cells read-only as possible. All markdown cells should be read-only. Many code cells that you don't want the students to be able to edit should be read-only. What the notebook should end up looking like is mostly read-only with sparsly distributed editable code cells in which the students implement focused exercises.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mirror the topics in the Learning Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "Just as in the Exercise notebooks, there should be a bulleted list that summarizes the topics that they will be tested on. In practice this will usually mirror the same bulleted list of topics that are covered in the Exercise notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "### NEVER use hidden cells for grading\n",
    "\n",
    "This makes things a bit complicated to create graded cells that don't give away the answer but hidden cells make it impossible for the students to get immediate feedback on their answers which is a non-negotiable requirement.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Make the exercises self-contained if possible\n",
    "\n",
    "If a student cannot get the answer to an exercise in the middle of the notebook, it would be nice if they were able to continue on with the next ones. This may not always be possible but you should try to do so whenever possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Make every exercise notebook sum to 20 points\n",
    "\n",
    "If a student cannot get the answer to an exercise in the middle of the notebook, it would be nice if they were able to continue on with the next ones. This may not always be possible but you should try to do so whenever possible."

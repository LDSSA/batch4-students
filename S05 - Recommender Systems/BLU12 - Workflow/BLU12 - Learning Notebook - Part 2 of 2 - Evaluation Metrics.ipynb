    "It is possible to conceptualize a recommendation problem as a regression problem if the objective of the analysis is to predict the value of an numerical indicator, such as ratings. If you want to predict the value of a given indicator for a specific item and user, you can - theoretically - solve it as a regression problem. By defining users' and items variables as independent variables and the respective rating as the dependent variable (like the example below), it is possible to solve it with regression models. \n",

    "\n",
    "Basically when using search engines or asking for advice from a librarian, we are engaging in IR. We are using search terms to perform a query over a large collection of resources. We aren't going into much detail on IR. What is important to us is how a recommender system compares to an Information Retrieval System (IRS) and how IR evaluates the accuracy of the results.\n",

IR usually deals with queries created by the user while with RS there isn't a direct query from the user. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We can think of it in the following matter: a Recommender System is an Information Retrieval system that answers the query \"What items best satisfy this user?\".\n",

    "\n",
    "The IR results are provided as a ranked list of documents starting with the documents that best fit the query criteria to the documents that least fit the criteria. \n",
    "Consider the example where we use a search engine to find web pages regarding regression - as in regression analysis. For us, a web page with detailed information on regression analysis is more useful than a page that simple states the definition of regression or a page about age regression or the movie *Regression (2015)*. This degree of \"usefulness\" can be used to rank the results - provided there is feedback. \n",
    "\n",
    "A relevant document (or result) is a document that is expected by the user. Using the previous example, the pages about age regression and the movie are not relevant to the user. Having increased number of non-relevant results is an indicator of poor IR performance.\n",

Note that the value of the AUPRC for a no skill model <b>is equal the proportion of positive cases</b> when $N$ is equal to the number of all available items([Source](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0118432)).

    "The AUPRC can be particularly useful when the fraction of positive cases is small and when identifying a positive case is more important than identifying negative cases. These conditions typically happen in medical applications where the incidence of a condition is low - low number positive cases - and is more important to identify the condition than to verify that the pacient does not have the condition. In RS these conditions also apply. The users can only access a tiny amount of all available items; just consider the amount of books, movies, series, products, etc. The amount of relevant items is, therefore, significantly smaller than non-relevant items. Furthermore, it is more important to recommend relevant items than to make sure that non-relevant items are not recommended. The user might even like the - supposedly - non-relevant item afterall. Take the case of [Plastic Love - Mariya Takeuchi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bNITQR4Uso).

    "Another approach is to consider the rank of the relevant items as one variable and the rank of the recommendations as another variable. In this case it is appropriated to use rank correlation coefficients to evaluate the **ordinal** relationship between them. One of these rank correlation coefficients was already discussed on SLU05 - Covariance and Correlation: the **Spearman's rank correlation coefficient, $r_s$**. \n",
    "\n",
    "To calculate the rank correlation, the **rank** of each item on the $\\{Relevant\\ Items\\}_u$ is compared with the **rank of the same item** on $\\{Retrieved\\ Items\\}_u$. We can define two rank variables: User's Preferences Ranks (*PR*) and Recommendations Ranks (*RR*), where the user's and recommendations' ranks for each item are stored, respectively. The overall order of the ranks in these variables is not important. What matters is that the **position of an item has to be the same on both variables. If the first element of PR is the user's preferences rank of \"Item X\" then the first element of RR has be the recommendations rank of \"Item X\" and so forth.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Considering the case above, we can identify the rank of each item of $\\{Relevant\\ Items\\}_u$ and $\\{Retrieved\\ Items\\}_u$. By reording the RR\n",
    "to have the items on the same position as PR it is easier to see matching items can have different rank value between PR and RR. For instance, the item \"apple\" is the user's second (2) preferred item while it is the fifth (5) recommended item.\n",

    "\n",
    "where $i$ iterates over the items, $n$ is the number of ranks (items) to be compared and $d_i = PR_i - RR_i$ is the difference of ranks for item $i$. In our case $n$ can be the cut off $k$ on the number of relevant items. \n",
    "\n",
    "The Spearman's rank correlation coefficient can have values ranging between -1 and 1. Correlation of 1 indicates that the order of the ranks in both variables are exactly the same, while correlation of -1 indicates that the variables have fully opposed order. Correlation of 0 indicates that the variables are completely independent. One should note that the computation of the correlation is vulnerable to the presence of missing items, mainly in $\\{Retrieved\\ Items\\}_u$."

    "There are a lot more metrics that can be used to evaluate the outcomes of recommender systems. The preference from one metric to another depends on multiple factors such as output type (binary, ordinal, recommendations), the type of users' feddback, business requirements and ease of interpretation. We have explored some of the common metrics for recommender systems. It is encouraged to explore other metrics.

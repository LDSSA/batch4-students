    "## 3. Some considerations about kNN\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have some intuition on how kNN works, and we've seen some functions that can be used as a distance (i.e, a measure of similarity), let's go through some considerations about this algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Non-parametric\n",
    "\n",
    "kNN is a non-parametric model because its structure is not specified a priori but is instead determined from the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "To better understand what this means, we can think of a counter example: Linear Regression, which is a parametric model, assumes that the data follows a linear distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### No learning\n",
    "\n",
    "When we described how does kNN work, you may have noticed a key difference between this algorithm and other algorithms that you've seen before, like Linear Regression or Logistic Regression: in kNN we don't actually learn anything!\n",
    "\n",
    "Taking Linear Regression as an example, in the traning phase, we used training data to learn some parameters ($\\beta$) that were later used in the prediction phase to make predictions on unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In kNN we don't learn any parameters, and in the training phase we don´t do more than just loading the training dataset into memory. Instead, most of the action takes place at prediction time, when we determine the nearest neighbours (using training data), and make predictions based on them. This is why we say that kNN is a **lazy** method.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### How to chose the value of _k_\n",
    "\n",
    "The optimal choice of the value *k* is highly data-dependent: in general a larger _k_ suppresses the effects of noise, but making it too large results in more prediction errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "In `SLU18 - Hyperparameter Tuning`, we'll learn how to systematically find the best value for _k_.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### kNN and high dimensional spaces\n",
    "\n",
    "When we increase the number of features in our model, we need more dimensions to represent the data points.\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem with high dimensional spaces is that the data gets very sparse, and consequently, points tend not to be close to each other. In particular, the k-nearest neighbours of a point won't be much closer to it than any other random points, which breaks the algorithm's assumption that points that are close are also similar.\n",
    "\n",
    "This phenomenon, called **curse of dimensionality**, is very well explained with an example [here](http://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs4780/2018fa/lectures/lecturenote02_kNN.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "This problem exists when we use the euclidean distance and the dot product, as these two distances measure amplitudes.\n",
    "The same doesn't happen with the cosine distance, that just considers directions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another way to avoid this is to use dimensionality reduction techinques, in order to simplify our data. This won't be covered in this course.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### kNN and large datasets\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a dataset with _N_ training points, when we try to get a prediction for a certain point, we need to load the entire dataset into memory and compute the distance between this point and all the other points.\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that the time that it takes to yield a prediction, depends on the dataset size. In fact, it grows linearly with it!\n",
    "\n",
    "Given these considerations, it's easy to understand that kNN is not the best choice when the dataset is very large.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are some ways to make kNN run faster, but these are out of the scope of this SLU!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Theoretically perfect\n",
    "\n",
    "K-nearest neighbors is a well-studied approach. There are many important theorems claiming that, on \"endless\" datasets, it is the optimal method of classification. \n",
    "\n",
    "The authors of the classic book \"The Elements of Statistical Learning\" consider k-NN to be a theoretically ideal algorithm which usage is only limited by computation power and the curse of dimensionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "### kNN in the real world\n",
    "\n",
    "kNN can serve as a good starting approach (baseline) in some cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "kNN might also be used in recommendation systems. The initial approach might be to recommend a product that is popular among K most similar people to a client.\n",
    "\n",
    "On Kaggle competitions, kNN is often used as a part of more complicated models that combine different approaches (those methods are called stacking and blending, but they are out of this course scope)"
